# Mobile App Design Patterns

- 1. Provider Pattern
     The Provider pattern is a state management pattern that helps to manage the state of the application
     in a more organized way. It allows the state to be shared across multiple widgets in the application while
     reducing the boilerplate(repetitive or redundant code that is often needed when managing state in an application)
     code. The Provider pattern is a popular choice for Flutter mobile applications because 
     it provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state in the application.

- 2. Bloc Pattern
   The BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is another popular design pattern for Flutter mobile applications. 
     It separates the presentation layer from the business logic layer, making it easier to manage the application's state.
     In the BLoC pattern, the widget sends an event to the BLoC layer, which then updates the state of the application,
     and the widget is updated accordingly.

- 3. MVC Pattern
   The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a well-known design pattern that separates the application
   into three different components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.
     The Model represents the data and the business logic, the View represents the user interface,
     and the Controller handles the communication between the Model and the View. 
     The MVC pattern is a popular choice for building Flutter mobile applications because it provides 
     a clean and organized architecture that separates the concerns of the application.

- 4. MVP Pattern
   The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern is another popular design pattern for building Flutter mobile applications.
   It separates the user interface from the business logic, making it easier to test and maintain the code.
   The MVP pattern is similar to the MVC pattern, but instead of using a Controller, 
   it uses a Presenter to handle the communication between the Model and the View.

- 5. MVVM Pattern
   The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is a design pattern that separates the application into three
   different components: the Model, the View, and the ViewModel. 
   The Model represents the data and the business logic, the View represents the user interface,
   and the ViewModel acts as a mediator between the Model and the View. 
   The MVVM pattern is a popular choice for building Flutter mobile applications because it provides
   a clean and organized architecture that separates the concerns of the application.
